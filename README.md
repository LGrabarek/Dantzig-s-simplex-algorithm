# Dantzig's simplex algorithm

WinSimplex was written in C++ and compiled to run in Windows. It is a step-by-step implementation of the simplex method of linear programming.  I wrote the program in 2014 while teaching Applied Finite Mathematics at the University of Alaska Anchorage, to help my students with the otherwise computationally tedious process.
